<h2>About Cold Play Band</h2>
<p>Coldplay are a British rock band formed in London in 1996. Vocalist, rhythm guitarist and pianist Chris Martin, 
    lead guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, and drummer Will Champion met at University College London 
    and began playing music together from 1996 to 1998, first calling themselves Pectoralz and then Starfish before 
    finally changing their name to Coldplay. Their creative director and former manager Phil Harvey is considered 
    the fifth member of the band.</p>
    <p>
        Coldplay have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists.
        They have won numerous awards throughout their career, including nine Brit Awards, seven MTV Video Music Awards, 
        eight MTV Europe Music Awards and seven Grammy Awards from 35 nominations.
        The band's first three albums — Parachutes (2000), A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), and X&Y (2005) — are among 
        the best-selling albums in UK chart history. In December 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the fourth-best artist of the 2000s,
        and Q magazine included the group in their Artists of the Century list.
